# Practice Lab: Managing local and network printers

## Summary

In this exercise, you will perform basic printer configuration. You will add a local printer by using Devices and Printers.

You need to configure these printers as requested. After you configure the printers you will have a user named Terry test that she can only print to the printer on SEA-SVR2, and that print jobs initiated from SEA-SVR2 can be seen in the queue on SEA-SVR1.
