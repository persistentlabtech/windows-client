# Practice Lab: Provision a Kiosk using Configuration Designer

## Summary

In this lab, you create a provisioning package to configure a Windows 11 device to run a single application when a specific user account is used to sign in.

### Scenario

In the reception area at Contoso, itâ€™s necessary to deploy a new Windows 11 computer as a kiosk device. This new device will only run Microsoft News to provide guests the ability to review the latest News events. You need to use the Configuration Designer to create a provisioning package to configure kiosk settings on the device.
